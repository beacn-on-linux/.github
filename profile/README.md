# Beacn on Linux

A group of repositories and tools attempting to add Beacn hardware support to Linux! Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PdsscuEhMh)

## What are we doing?
The end goal of this org will be to have all Beacn hardware devices supported in some way on Linux, we're not looking at pretty, 
but we are looking at functional!

## When?!
When code is written, this is a big project to bring an entire ecosystem to Linux, so it'll take some time to put things together.
