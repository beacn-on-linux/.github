### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

For the Beacn Mic and Beacn Studio, our code directly modifies the on-board storage. While it's been tested and made to be as safe as
is possible, it was derived from reverse engineering and thus may not be accurate.

This project is not supported by, or affiliated in any way with Beacn. For official Beacn software, please refer
to their website.

In addition, this project accepts no responsibility or liability for any use of this software, or any problems
which may occur from its use. Please read the LICENSE for more information.

## Beacn Utility
Most our work is currently focused on the [Beacn Utility](https://github.com/beacn-on-linux/beacn-utility), a tool designed to
communicate with, and control Beacn devices. We currently support changing the DSP values of the Beacn Mic and Beacn Studio. Beacn
Mix and Beacn Mix Create work is currently ongoing.

## When?!
When code is written, this is a big project to bring an entire ecosystem to Linux, so it'll take some time to put things together.
