# Beacn on Linux

From the maker of the GoXLR Utility, lets look at Beacn hardware! Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PdsscuEhMh)

## What are we doing?
The goal is to have all beacn hardware working under Linux in some form or another. Early code is going to focus on the Beacn Mic, prior to looking into the Mix and Mix Create.

For audio mixing, it's likely going to be some involvement with [PipeCast](https://github.com/PipeCast), I'm currently not sure how it's going to all hook together, but it'll be a journey taken together as I work on both projects.

## When?!
When code is written, this is a big project to bring an entire ecosystem to Linux, so it'll take some time to put things together.
